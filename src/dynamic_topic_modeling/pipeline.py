# Here you can define your data-driven pipeline by importing your functions
# and adding them to the pipeline as follows:
#
# from nodes.data_wrangling import clean_data, compute_features
#
# pipeline = Pipeline([
#     node(clean_data, 'customers', 'prepared_customers'),
#     node(compute_features, 'prepared_customers', ['X_train', 'Y_train'])
# ])
#
# Once you have your pipeline defined, you can run it from the root of your
# project by calling:
#
# $ kedro run
